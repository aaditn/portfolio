### Apple Year 1 -- Energy Generating Seesaw

Spent a summer at an engineering camp hosted by Apple building an energy-generating seesaw paired with a full-stack iOS data app.

I aided in the electrical design and implementation of the hardware, capturing instantaneous power output through a current sensor on a Raspberry Pi. This data was sent via HTTP to a Flask backend. I also implemented local data storage for user-based records with a roadmap to migrate to cloud storage.
